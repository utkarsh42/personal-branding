## Tips for Success

1. **Be specific with metrics** - "100% success rate" not "very successful"
2. **Show your work** - Code snippets, screenshots, actual workflows
3. **Stay authentic** - Real challenges, real learnings, real metrics
4. **Build in public** - Share the V3 transformation journey transparently
5. **Engage authentically** - Comment on 10 relevant posts daily
6. **Batch create** - Draft multiple posts at once, schedule throughout week
7. **Repurpose** - Twitter thread → LinkedIn post → Blog article
