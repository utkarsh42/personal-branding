## Example Structure

**Hook**:
> "We just hit 100% success rate in our AI Q&A system. Here's what it took."

**Story**:
> "6 months ago, our Ask Inc42 system had a 28.5% pass rate. Basically, unusable. The problem? Our LLM was trying to do everything - answer questions, route queries, validate outputs, and handle errors. It was overwhelmed."

**Insights**:
> "What worked:
> 1. **Intelligent query routing** - 3 specialized tools instead of one generic RAG (60% improvement)
> 2. **Retry logic with fallbacks** - 3 attempts per tool, fallback to backup tool (eliminated 90% of failures)
> 3. **Output schema validation** - JSON schema enforcement before returning results (caught malformed responses)"

**CTA**:
> "What's your biggest challenge with production LLM systems? Drop a comment - I'm collecting real-world debugging stories."
