## Day 2: First Post Draft (1.5 hours)

### Write: "How I Use Claude Code to Build Production AI Systems"

**Hook** (First 2 lines - stop scrolling):
```
I ship production AI systems with a 5-person team, no ML expertise, and a $500/month budget.

My secret? Claude Code as co-developer.
```

**Outline** (use `templates/linkedin-post.md`):

1. **Context** (100 words):
   - Building Ask Inc42 (AI Q&A system, v2.7.3, live in production)
   - 5-person team, no ML expertise, competing with $100M+ competitors
   - Shipped 15 optimization cycles in 6 months
   - Claude Code is core to our development workflow

2. **How I Use Claude Code** (400 words):
   - **Testing Automation**: test-suite creation, smoke tests, validation
     - Example: Enhanced test suite design (39.2% baseline)
     - Testing-lib.sh and version-bump.sh automation
   - **Deployment Workflows**: n8n JSON manipulation, workflow sync
     - Example: n8n-lib.sh for production workflow management
     - Atomic deployments with testing

## Day 5: Second Post Draft (1 hour)

### Write: "Four-ICP GTM Strategy: Data-Driven Positioning"

**Hook**:
```
We analyzed 123,318 users in PostHog.

Only 4,404 (3.5%) had ICP data.

Here's what we learned about our customers.
```

**Outline**:

1. **The Problem** (100 words):
   - Datalabs serving multiple ICPs (investors, founders, sales, consultants)
   - 96.5% of users had NULL User_Profile_Fixed
   - Couldn't optimize GTM without understanding who's activating

2. **The Analysis** (300 words):
   - PostHog demographic breakdown
   - 4,404 identified users across 4 ICPs + students
   - Activation rates, revenue share, ARPU modeling
   - Data quality crisis and backfill strategy

3. **Four-ICP Model** (400 words):
   - **ICP 1: Investors (11.4%)**: VCs, angels, family offices
     - Activation: 74.9% | Revenue Share: 40-44% | ARPU: ₹150-300K
     - Use cases: Deal sourcing, diligence, portfolio monitoring
   - **ICP 2: Founders (40.3% - LARGEST)**: Startup founders, CFOs
     - Activation: 72.9% | Revenue Share: 30-35% | ARPU: ₹60K
     - Use cases: Fundraising prep, competitor tracking
   - **ICP 3: Sales & Marketing (14.3%)**: SDRs, AEs, growth teams
     - Activation: 77.6% | Revenue Share: 15-20% | ARPU: ₹60-150K
     - Use cases: Lead enrichment, pipeline intelligence
   - **ICP 4: Consultants (~8% - NEW)**: Strategy consultants, analysts
     - Activation: TBD | Revenue Share: 5-10% | ARPU: ₹150K (60-day pilot)
     - Use cases: Research that bills
   - **Non-ICP: Students (~12%)**: Strategic non-revenue segment (FREE tier)
     - Activation: 79.4% (highest!) | Revenue Share: 0% | ARPU: ₹0

4. **GTM Implications** (300 words):
   - Founders are largest segment (not investors) - shift content strategy
   - Students have highest activation - onboarding works, just don't monetize
   - Sales/Marketing has highest activation + revenue - prioritize for growth
   - Consultants new pilot - testing ₹150K ARPU hypothesis

5. **Framework for Others**:
   - Start with PostHog demographic analysis
   - Filter for users with profile data
   - Calculate activation, revenue share, ARPU by segment
   - Prioritize by combination of size + activation + revenue potential
   - Build ICP-specific campaigns

**CTA**:

## Day 6: Building in Public Template (30 minutes)

### Write: "Week 1 - Quality Baseline Established"

Use `templates/building-in-public.md` template:

```markdown
# Week 1: Quality Baseline Established - 39.2% → 70-90% Roadmap

Building Ask Inc42 in public. Every Friday I share wins, losses, and lessons.

## What Shipped 🚀
- **OPT-068 Deployed**: Datalabs validation fix (0% → 80% success rate)
  - Fixed validation sub-workflow ID extraction
  - Sequential execution architecture (+1-2s latency trade-off)
  - Validation test suite: 4/4 passed (31.5s avg response time)
  - Version: v2.7.3 (PATCH release)

- **Quality Baseline Established**: 39.2% pass rate documented
  - Enhanced test suite run (28 queries across 3 ICPs)
  - False positive detection: 1/11 "OK" queries (9.1%)
  - Root cause verified: Downstream API rate limits, not n8n infrastructure
  - Baseline documented: docs/benchmarks/quality-baseline-v2.7.3.md

## Metrics 📊
| Metric | Last Week | This Week | Change |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Success Rate | 46.4% (v2.7.1) | 57.1% (v2.7.2) | +10.7pp (OPT-065) |
| Datalabs Success | 0% (broken) | 80% (fixed) | +80pp (OPT-068) |
| Response Time | 31-35s | 31.5s avg | Stable |
| Deployments | 2 | 2 | v2.7.2 + v2.7.3 |

## Key Learnings 💡
1. **Infrastructure NOT the bottleneck**: Queue mode verified active (5 concurrent queries in 29s). Real bottleneck: Downstream API rate limits (Datalabs ~5-8 q/s, Inc42 APIs ~10 concurrent).

2. **False positives matter**: 9.1% of "OK" queries are false positives (Query I6). Quality measurement must account for this.

3. **Trade-offs are real**: Sequential execution (+1-2s latency) fixed 80pp improvement in Datalabs success. Worth it.

4. **Claude Code saves 5-7 hrs/week**: Developer Productivity Toolkit complete (version-bump.sh, testing-lib.sh, n8n-lib.sh).

## Next Week Focus 🎯
- Test delay optimization (quick win: +10-20pp from API rate limit backoff)
- False positive fix (Query I6 reclassification)
- API rate limit optimization (target: 70-85% success rate)
- OPT-066: Regression investigation (3 regressions identified)

## Ask Me Anything
What's your experience optimizing production AI systems?

Any tips on API rate limit management?
