## Day 6: Building in Public Template (30 minutes)

### Write: "Week 1 - Building in Public: Ask Inc42 Live + Datalabs V3 Roadmap"

Use `templates/building-in-public.md` template:

```markdown
# Week 1: Ask Inc42 Live + Datalabs V3 Roadmap

Building in public as Co-founder @ Inc42. Every Friday I share wins, metrics, and learnings.

## What Shipped 🚀
- **OPT-068 Deployed**: Datalabs validation fix (0% → 80% success rate)
  - Fixed validation sub-workflow ID extraction
  - Sequential execution architecture (+1-2s latency trade-off)
  - Validation test suite: 4/4 passed (31.5s avg response time)
  - Version: v2.7.3 (PATCH release)

- **Quality Baseline Established**: 39.2% pass rate documented
  - Enhanced test suite run (28 queries across 3 ICPs)
  - False positive detection: 1/11 "OK" queries (9.1%)
  - Root cause verified: Downstream API rate limits, not n8n infrastructure
  - Baseline documented: docs/benchmarks/quality-baseline-v2.7.3.md

## Metrics 📊
| Metric | Last Week | This Week | Change |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Success Rate | 46.4% (v2.7.1) | 57.1% (v2.7.2) | +10.7pp (OPT-065) |
| Datalabs Success | 0% (broken) | 80% (fixed) | +80pp (OPT-068) |
| Response Time | 31-35s | 31.5s avg | Stable |
| Deployments | 2 | 2 | v2.7.2 + v2.7.3 |

## Key Learnings 💡
1. **Infrastructure NOT the bottleneck**: Queue mode verified active (5 concurrent queries in 29s). Real bottleneck: Downstream API rate limits (Datalabs ~5-8 q/s, Inc42 APIs ~10 concurrent).

2. **False positives matter**: 9.1% of "OK" queries are false positives (Query I6). Quality measurement must account for this.

3. **Trade-offs are real**: Sequential execution (+1-2s latency) fixed 80pp improvement in Datalabs success. Worth it.

4. **Claude Code saves 5-7 hrs/week**: Developer Productivity Toolkit complete (version-bump.sh, testing-lib.sh, n8n-lib.sh).

## Next Week Focus 🎯
- Test delay optimization (quick win: +10-20pp from API rate limit backoff)
- False positive fix (Query I6 reclassification)
- API rate limit optimization (target: 70-85% success rate)
- OPT-066: Regression investigation (3 regressions identified)

## Ask Me Anything
What's your experience optimizing production AI systems?

Any tips on API rate limit management?
