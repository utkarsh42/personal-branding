## Guardrails

**Always Include**:
- Specific metrics (not "improved a lot")
- Concrete examples from your work
- Actionable insights (not just theory)
- Authentic challenges (not just successes)

**Avoid**:
- Pure promotional content
- Generic advice without context
- Claims without evidence
- Topics outside your direct experience

**Quality Check**:
- [ ] Does this align with at least one pillar?
- [ ] Does this showcase your unique experience?
- [ ] Would your target audience find this valuable?
- [ ] Is this specific and actionable?

---

## Evolution

Review quarterly:
- Which pillars are resonating most?
- Which audience segments are engaging?
- Should we shift pillar distribution?
- Any new sub-topics emerging?
