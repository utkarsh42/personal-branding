## Elevator Pitches

### 30-Second Pitch (Networking)

> I'm Co-founder @ Inc42, building AI intelligence products for India's startup economy. Think Ask Inc42 - live AI Q&A with 100% success rate - and Datalabs V3, launching Q2'26 as a dual-mode intelligence co-pilot tracking 21,000+ Indian startups. I also curate Griffin Club, our community of 50+ unicorn founders with NPS 82. My strength is multi-dimensional execution: handling product, GTM, AI, and ecosystem curation all at once. We're a 5-person team competing with $100M+ funded competitors on a $500/month budget.

### 60-Second Pitch (Investor/Detailed)

> I'm Co-founder @ Inc42, building AI-powered intelligence products that serve India's 127K startups, 114 unicorns, and $150B ecosystem.
>
> We have two products: Ask Inc42, a live AI Q&A system with 100% answer success rate and 31-second response time, and Datalabs V3, launching Q2'26 as a dual-mode intelligence co-pilot. Datalabs tracks 21,000+ Indian startups - that's 4x more than Crunchbase India - with newsroom-verified data updated in under 24 hours. We're priced at ₹60-150K, which is 10x cheaper than Tracxn (₹6-12L).
>
> What's unique is our journalism-driven moat. Inc42 has 11 years of ecosystem coverage, cited by Mary Meeker and Forbes, with ₹35 Cr revenue and 5-10x lower CAC than competitors. This gives us proprietary intelligence that can't be replicated with capital alone.
>
> I also curate Griffin Club, our community of 50+ unicorn founders with NPS 82. This gives us exclusive insider perspectives on where the ecosystem is heading.
>
> My role is multi-dimensional: product strategy, GTM execution (4-ICP model, pricing, campaigns), AI implementation (RAG, LangChain, n8n), and business modeling. We're a 5-person team with a $500/month GTM budget, competing with well-funded global players by being India-first and constraint-driven.

### Technical Pitch (Developer Audience)

> I build production AI intelligence systems as Co-founder @ Inc42. Our stack: n8n workflow orchestration, LangChain for agent logic, OpenAI GPT-4o/GPT-4o-mini hybrid, Elasticsearch for structured queries, and Vector RAG for context.
>
> Ask Inc42 (live) handles 60,000+ articles with intelligent query routing across three specialized tools: vector RAG for context, semantic search for recent news, and Elasticsearch for structured company data. We've achieved 100% answer success rate through retry logic, output validation, and fallback strategies - all without dedicated ML expertise.
>
> Datalabs V3 (launching Q2'26) is a dual-mode intelligence co-pilot (Ask Mode + Discover Mode) with AI agent architecture. We're implementing Tier 1 agents (Notion Sync, Draft Reviewer, Phase Tracker) using the same n8n + LangChain stack.
>
> Constraint-driven: 5-person team, no ML expertise, $500/month infrastructure. Competing with $100M+ competitors through smart architecture and scrappy execution.

- Activation rates (aggregated): "Sales 77.6%, Founders 72.9%, Investors 74.9%"
