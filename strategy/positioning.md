## Elevator Pitches

### 30-Second (Networking)
> "I build AI-powered intelligence tools for India's startup ecosystem at Inc42. Think of it as making sense of 60,000+ startup stories and funding data through conversational AI. We just shipped Ask Inc42 with 100% success rate, and now transforming Datalabs into an AI co-pilot - all with a 5-person team and a $500/month marketing budget. It's scrappy, but we're competing with $100M+ funded competitors."

### 60-Second (Investor/Detailed)
> "I'm building production AI systems at Inc42 that transform startup intelligence from search-based to conversational. We have two products: Ask Inc42, an AI Q&A system live with 100% success rate and 31-second response time, and Datalabs V3, launching Q2 2026 as a dual-mode intelligence co-pilot.
>
> What's unique: We're a 5-person team with no ML expertise, running a $500/month GTM stack, competing against Tracxn and Crunchbase. Our advantage is India-specific data, AI-first architecture, and scrappy execution. We've sized the market at $39M TAM, targeting investors, sales teams, and founders.
>
> I handle product strategy, technical implementation (n8n + LangChain + GPT-4), GTM strategy, and business modeling. Building in public with full transparency on metrics and learnings."

### Technical (Developer Audience)
> "I build production RAG systems using n8n workflow orchestration, LangChain for agent logic, and OpenAI GPT-4o-mini. Our stack handles 60,000+ articles with intelligent query routing across three specialized tools: vector RAG for context, semantic search for recent news, and Elasticsearch for structured company data. We've achieved 100% success rate through retry logic, output validation, and fallback strategies - all without dedicated ML expertise."
